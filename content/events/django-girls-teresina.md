# Django Girls Teresina

On November 8, 2025, PyLadies Teresina will host the 5th edition of the Django Girls Teresina workshop. As this is a year of celebration, we will join the festivities by celebrating Django’s anniversary with all the girls. There’s no better way to celebrate than by building with Django and welcoming beginners into the world of programming through this framework.

This will be a full-day event dedicated to promoting the inclusion of women and girls in web development.

## How to attend

The event is in person. Participants registered in advance, and the selected attendees do not need to bring a laptop, we will provide a computer for each of them.
