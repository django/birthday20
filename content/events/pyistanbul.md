# Django's 20th Birthday ðŸŽ‚ Seaside Picnic

Hello Python Istanbul!

This summer, Django turns 20 â€” weâ€™ll celebrate with a casual picnic at Maltepe Coast during sunset, with friendly conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.

Weâ€™re inviting Django developers, Python enthusiasts, and anyone who enjoys spending time by the sea.

Bring your own picnic food, beverages, a folding chair or blanket.

Yes... Weâ€™ll also have a Django birthday cake to celebrate Djangoâ€™s 20th year!

## How to attend

RSVP is not required, but it helps us to know how many people to expect. You can join us by simply showing up at the venue.

RSVP on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/python-istanbul/events/310466532/).
