# Django (birth)Day Copenhagen 2025

We've done a lot of Django Day Copenhagen in the past, in fact we've done 5! But this year, we needed a break, and what better way to have a break than to do a birthday for Django!?

## What we're gonna do

We booked the basement at Too Old To Die Young, a bar on Nørrebro. From 15:00, we're open and you can come by for an after-work drink, snacks and cake.

If you're interested in doing something fun at the event, please reach out to info@django-denmark.org

The schedule is like this:

<pre>
15:00 open
16:00 welcoming keynote & cake
16:30 special events - please help!
17:00 music
18:00 the program is over
</pre>

If you are hungry at 18, it should be possible to eat at the venue, but we have to make some arrangement around how to book the food.

## How to attend

You need a ticket! It's very cheap, and we pay you back with cake, chips and a drink.
