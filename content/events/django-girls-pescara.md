# Django Girls Pescara

On November 8, 2025, Python Pescara will host the 2th edition of the Django Girls Pescara workshop. As this is a year of celebration, we will join the festivities by celebrating Django’s anniversary with all the participants. There’s no better way to celebrate than by building with Django and welcoming beginners into the world of programming through this framework.

This will be a full-day event dedicated to promoting the inclusion of women and girls in web development.

## How to attend

The event is in person. Participants registered in advance, and during the day we will celebrate the 20th annoversary of Django with a cake for every attendees.

## Code of Conduct

Please see the [Code of Conduct from Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/coc/).
