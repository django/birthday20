## Stay tuned!

Django birthday events are being organized. This website is where it happens and where you can keep your self updated. Have a look at the [map](#map), the [events list](#events).

## A special call for proposals! BIRTHDAYS!

To mark the event, we are calling for everyone to do a little thing! Meet new people, or gather old familiar friends - down at the pub, in a park, at your school or online. Nothing is too small.

You can read more about hosting a birthday [here]({{< relref "/add-event.md" >}}).

## 20 years - what happened?

Soon we're annoucing a collaborative timeline, keep an eye out on this space.
